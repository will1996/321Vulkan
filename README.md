This project is designed to be a more friendly entry point into rendering, and game programming in general. 

The idea is that you can simply compile everything with CMake, and then import a header, and have a renderer that lets you play around with traingles. 

A cursory examination will see that this is a small variation on the now famous VulkanTutorial, which is no mistake, the code is transcribed almost verbatim from there. 
The tutorial should be used in conjuction with this code, However, this implementation is portable, a feature which the tutorial is lacking. 

The portability allows you to take the progress you make in the tutorial, and apply it to whatever projects you want! 

Enjoy.
